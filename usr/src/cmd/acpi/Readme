The ACPI utilities are based on the Intel ACPI source code drops.  Aside from
notes in Readme.resync files, no changes are made to Intel-provided source code.
Most of the ACPI source code lives in
the following directories:

   usr/src/uts/common/acpica		Common to kernel and commands
   usr/src/uts/intel/io/acpica		Kernel
   usr/src/uts/intel/sys/acpi		Headers
   usr/src/cmd/acpi			Commands

The acpica-update script in this directory can serve as a guide for performing
updates.  It is expected that it will need to be tweaked as the upstream acpica
software evolves.

The expected workflow for updating is

1. Clone the appropriate acpica workspace from github.  Until such a time
   as Joyent's changes to acpica are in the Intel distribution, this probably
   means:

     git clone -b smartos git@github.com:joyent/acpica.git

2. Do any required development work in the workspace checked out in step 1.
   This probably includes rebasing Joyent's changes on the latest release.
   Don't forget to push these to github and submit a pull request if
   appropriate.

3. Build and test the modified acpica disto as described in the documentation
   in that workspace.

4. Run acpica-update from within an illumos workspace.  That is:

     ./acpica-update ~/acpica

5. Build, test, code review, etc.
