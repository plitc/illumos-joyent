/*
 * HT exclusion: prevent a sibling in a hyper-threaded core from running in VMX
 * non-root guest mode, when certain threads are running on the other sibling.
 * This avoids speculation-based information leaks such as L1TF being available
 * to the untrusted guest.  The stance we take is that threads from the same
 * zone as the guest VPCU thread are considered safe to run alongside, but all
 * other threads (except the idle thread), and all interrupts, are unsafe.  Note
 * that due to the implementation here, there are significant sections of e.g.
 * the dispatcher code that can run concurrently with a guest, until the thread
 * reaches ht_mark().  This code assumes there are only two HT threads per core.
 *
 * The entry points are as follows:
 *
 * ht_mark_as_vcpu()
 *
 * All threads that enter guest mode (i.e. VCPU threads) need to call this at
 * least once, which sets TS_VCPU in ->t_schedflag.
 *
 * ht_mark()
 *
 * A new ->cpu_thread is now curthread (although interrupt threads have their
 * own separate handling).  After preventing any interrupts, we will take our
 * own CPU's spinlock and update our own state in mcpu_ht.
 *
 * If our sibling is poisoned (i.e. in guest mode or the little bit of code
 * around it), and we're not compatible (that is, same zone ID, or the idle
 * thread), then we need to ht_kick() that sibling.  ht_kick() itself waits for
 * the sibling to call ht_release(), and it will not re-enter guest mode until
 * allowed.
 *
 * Note that we ignore the fact a process can change its zone ID: poisoning
 * threads never do so, and we can ignore the other cases.
 *
 * ht_acquire()
 *
 * We are a VCPU thread about to start guest execution.  Interrupts are
 * disabled.  We must have already run ht_mark() to be in this code, so there's
 * no need to take our *own* spinlock in order to mark ourselves as CM_POISONED.
 * Instead, we take our sibling's lock to also mark ourselves as poisoned in the
 * sibling cpu_ht_t.  This is so ht_mark() will only ever need to look at its
 * local mcpu_ht.
 *
 * We'll loop here for up to ht_acquire_wait_time microseconds; this is mainly
 * to wait out any sibling interrupt: many of them will complete quicker than
 * this.
 *
 * Finally, if we succeeded in acquiring the core, we'll flush the L1 cache as
 * mitigation against L1TF: no incompatible thread will now be able to populate
 * the L1 cache until *we* ht_release().
 *
 * ht_release()
 *
 * Simply unpoison ourselves similarly to ht_acquire(); ht_kick() will wait for
 * this to happen if needed.
 *
 * ht_begin_intr()
 *
 * In an interrupt prolog.  We're either a hilevel interrupt, or a pinning
 * interrupt.  In both cases, we mark our interrupt depth, and potentially
 * ht_kick().  This enforces exclusion, but doesn't otherwise modify ->ch_state:
 * we want the dispatcher code to essentially ignore interrupts.
 *
 * ht_end_intr()
 *
 * In an interrupt epilogue *or* thread_unpin().  In the first case, we never
 * slept, and we can simply decrement our counter.  In the second case, we're an
 * interrupt thread about to sleep: we'll still just decrement our counter, and
 * henceforth treat the thread as a normal thread when it next gets scheduled,
 * until it finally gets to its epilogue.
 *
 * ht_mark_unsafe() / ht_mark_safe()
 *
 * Mark the current thread as temporarily unsafe (guests should not be executing
 * while a sibling is marked unsafe).  This can be used for a thread that's
 * otherwise considered safe, if it needs to handle potentially sensitive data.
 * Right now, this means certain I/O handling operations that reach down into
 * the networking and ZFS sub-systems.
 *
 * ht_should_run(thread, cpu)
 *
 * This is used by the dispatcher when making scheduling decisions: if the
 * sibling is compatible with the given thread, we return B_TRUE. This is
 * essentially trying to guess if any subsequent ht_acquire() will fail, by
 * peeking at the sibling CPU's state.  The peek is racy, but if we get things
 * wrong, the "only" consequence is that ht_acquire() may lose.
 *
 * ht_adjust_cpu_score()
 *
 * Used when scoring other CPUs in disp_lowpri_cpu().  If we shouldn't run here,
 * we'll add a small penalty to the score.  This also makes sure a VCPU thread
 * migration behaves properly.
